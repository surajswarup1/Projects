I have worked on diverse personal projects using Tableau that have showcased my data 
visualization skills across various domains. One notable project involved creating an 
interactive dashboard on Major League Baseball pitching data for the Houston Astros. 
The dashboard analyzes advanced pitching analytics over time such as spin rate, 
whiff percentage, and others, and can be filtered by pitch type and by player.
