I have worked on diverse personal projects using Tableau that have showcased my data visualization skills 
across various domains. One notable project involved creating an interactive dashboard on Major League Baseball 
pitching data for the Houston Astros. The dashboard analyzes advanced pitching analytics over time such as spin 
rate, whiff percentage, and others, and can be filtered by pitch type and by player. Another compelling project
focused on Spotify data, where I designed an interactive dashboard to analyze song popularity, song duration, and 
a few other metrics over the 2010s decade. Each project showcases my ability to transform raw data into actionable 
insights to allow for informed decision making and can be viewed using the links in the README file.
